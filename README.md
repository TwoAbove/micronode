Microservices on Node, made easy

## Docs

TBD

## Why

There are no nice implementations for creating microservices on node that suit my needs. This has to be fixed!

I wanted a module that took out much of the grunt work when adding a consumer or creator for RabbitMQ queues. This is the starting point.

## Support

If you really like this and use it, I will love a helping hand.
